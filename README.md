# Smart Medical Chatbot using Open-Source Tools

This project demonstrates how to build a smart medical chatbot using open-source tools. It utilizes Hugging Face for text embeddings, Faiss CPU for efficient vector storage and similarity search, and Mistral, a large language model, integrated with Streamlit for a conversational interface.  This tutorial is designed for beginners with no prior experience in chatbot development.

## Overview

This project provides a step-by-step guide to creating a functional medical chatbot.  It covers the following key aspects:

* **Text Embeddings with Hugging Face:**  Learn how to use Hugging Face Transformers to generate embeddings for medical text data.  These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling semantic search and question answering.
* **Efficient Vector Storage with Faiss:**  Understand how to use Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to store and efficiently search the generated embeddings. Faiss allows for fast retrieval of relevant information from a large corpus of medical knowledge.
* **Conversational Interface with Mistral and Streamlit:**  Integrate the powerful Mistral large language model with Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly chatbot interface.  Streamlit simplifies the process of building and deploying web applications for machine learning models.
* **Healthcare Focus:**  The chatbot is designed with a focus on medical applications, providing a foundation for building tools that can assist with answering medical questions and providing information.
